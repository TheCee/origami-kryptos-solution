Kryptos K4 Use Case — Origami Framework Application  
Version 1.0 — May 2025

---

## Objective

To produce a complete, reproducible solution to the final 97-character ciphertext (K4) on the Kryptos sculpture at CIA Headquarters.

---

## Method Summary

The solution was developed using the Origami Framework — a reasoning architecture designed to prevent hallucination, enforce fact/inference/interpretation labeling, and maintain a visible audit trail across each stage of inquiry.

No pre-existing solutions or decryption keys were used.  
All analysis was built through:

- Constraint identification (from known structure and CIA-confirmed clues)
- Pattern tracing (manual and AI-assisted symbol analysis)
- Synthesis through folding: symbolic and linguistic decoding

---

## What Was Produced

- A 97-character plaintext
- A proposed symbolic meaning
- Documentation of all key discovery steps
- Refusal to publish until every claim was traceable

---

## Key Excerpt from Final Interpretation

> IS IT BURIED UNDER THE CLOCK IN BERLIN  
> ONLY YOU KNOW WHERE  
> EAST OF THE POSITION  
> INVISIBLE UNTIL YOU LOOK  
> YOU AND I — THAT IS THE TRUTH  
> THERE IT IS  
> ONLY HE KNOWS

All elements are consistent with Kryptos’ known thematic structure (layers of secrecy, visible/invisible truth, dual authorship, Cold War reference, symbolic recursion).

## Status

- All steps logged
- Public ZIP includes decryption and audit trail
- Full framework remains private (Origami tools are referenced, not revealed)
