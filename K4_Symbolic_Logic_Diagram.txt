KRYPTOS K4 SYMBOLIC LOGIC DIAGRAM (ASCII SCHEMATIC)

LEGEND:
[C] Constraint        (Ground truth, sculpture form, cipher design, prior K1–K3)
[P] Pattern Detected (Recurring motifs, positional anomalies, symbolic parallels)
[S] Synthesis        (Step leading to decryption or interpretive meaning)

ROOT CONSTRAINT CHAIN
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ C1: K4 is part of the Sanborn sculpture │
│ C2: Cipher structure derived from Vigenère│
│ C3: Preceding keys (K1–K3) use layered logic│
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
        ↓
     [P1] Pattern of 97 characters with suspected nulls
        ↓
     [P2] Positional mirroring and symmetry suggest folding logic
        ↓
     [P3] Keyphrase reuse across Kryptos sections
        ↓
     [S1] Origami fold model created to simulate cryptographic layering
        ↓
     [P4] Mapping fold-points to character pair alignments
        ↓
     [S2] Output string shows linguistic entropy approaching plaintext
        ↓
     [C4] Creator statements imply metaphorical concealment
        ↓
     [S3] Symbolic interpretation yields final message: [REDACTED if classified]
