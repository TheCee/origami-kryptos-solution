Each logical “fold” is a symbolic transformation governed by fixed relationships.

### F/I/P Tagging:
- **F** = Fact (observable, verifiable, grounded)
- **I** = Inference (derived through valid transformation)
- **P** = Interpretation (symbolically inferred, culturally coherent)

## 🔷 Key Properties
- GPT-native (no APIs, plugins, or external knowledge docs)
- Fully auditable reasoning chain
- Compatible with cryptographic, symbolic, and artistic logic systems
- Prevents hallucination through fold anchoring

---

## 🔷 First Application: Kryptos K4 (2025)
- Problem: Final unsolved section of CIA’s Kryptos sculpture
- Outcome: Full 97-character symbolic solution using Origami Framework only
- Artifacts: Fold sequence, SHA-256 hash, Zenodo DOI, CIA submission, public GitHub repo

---

## 🔷 Future Applications
- Legal reasoning scaffolds
- Ethical logic generators
- Structured symbolic design (e.g. architecture, encryption, medicine)
- GPT auditing layers and compliance logic
