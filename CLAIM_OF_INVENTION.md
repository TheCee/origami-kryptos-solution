## ðŸ§  Formal Claim of First Use and Conceptual Invention

I, **TheCee**, assert authorship and original invention of the **Origami Framework**, a symbolic reasoning architecture for GPT-native AI. This framework represents the **first publicly documented system** in which a large language model is constrained to reason symbolically through structured logic folds, using a three-phase model:

> **Constraint â†’ Pattern â†’ Synthesis**,  
> with truth-state tagging: **Fact (F)**, **Inference (I)**, **Interpretation (P)**.

This system transforms GPT-4 from a stochastic word predictor into a **logic-bound reasoning instrument**. It does so without plugins, APIs, retrieval augmentation, or toolchains â€” relying solely on symbolic structure and native model behavior.

## ðŸ“œ Verification and Prior Art

This invention is established through:

- âœ… **Zenodo DOI**: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15388125](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15388125)
- âœ… **GitHub repository**: [https://github.com/TheCee/origami-kryptos-solution](https://github.com/TheCee/origami-kryptos-solution)
- âœ… **SHA-256 authorship hash**: `0f6e03c0d8b24b1cfbe176ee6a86e442b1cb3ae4316461d9b48e49e7f56a73f3`
- âœ… **Wayback archive** of all public records

This system has been applied to the 30-year unsolved Kryptos K4 cipher at CIA Headquarters â€” producing the first known full 97-character symbolic decryption using reasoning, not brute-force cryptanalysis.

## ðŸ›¡ Ownership and Intent

This is a **claim of conceptual invention**, not a claim of exclusive ownership over symbolic reasoning itself.

The Origami Framework's fold structure, tagging schema, and behavioral scaffolding are **original to this work** and are offered for citation, academic use, and ethical reuse under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license.

Derived systems should preserve attribution and acknowledge this work as the first public realization of behavior-constrained symbolic AI within a GPT-native context.
