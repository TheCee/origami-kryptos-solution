# Kryptos K4 Solution — Origami Framework

This repository contains the decrypted output, audit trail, and symbolic interpretation of the unsolved Kryptos K4 cipher — completed using a custom AI reasoning architecture called the **Origami Framework**.

## 📜 What This Contains

- ✅ Full 97-character K4 decryption
- 🧩 Symbolic interpretation aligned with Jim Sanborn’s artwork and themes
- 📁 Audit trail and custom GPT reasoning log
- 🧠 Origami Framework overview (used to solve K4 without guesswork)

## 🧭 About the Origami Framework

Origami is a truth-first architecture for building GPTs.  
It avoids speculation, tags all outputs (Fact / Inference / Interpretation), and forces reproducible logic.

Originally built to solve K4, it now applies across:
- Symbolic analysis
- AI alignment
- Cognitive modeling
- Ethical prompting
